# cutefarm
A farm management application.

###### I stopped working on this project. Since it was initally a way to learn Qt/C++ some parts are of poor quality. They would require a complete rewrite and I am not even sure if it compiles with Qt5. However, probably soemone is interested to pick it up, re-use various parts.
